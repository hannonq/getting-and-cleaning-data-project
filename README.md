This repository contains the R code and the files used to complete the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

# The Script
The script `run_analysis.R` executes the following steps:

1. Downloads the dataset, if needed
2. Loads the test and train data into R
3. Merges the two datasets 
4. Gives descriptive names to the variables
5. Extracts the features needed
6. Creates a new tidy dataset 
7. Saves the tidy dataset in a file named `tidydata.txt`
